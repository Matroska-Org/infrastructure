# The EBML RFC

The IETF's [CELLAR working
group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/) standardizes
different technologies useful for video archival, with Matroska being
the chosen container format.

Our first effort was creating an RFC ("Request For Comments", the
standard documents produced by the IETF) for the underlying technology
used by Matroska: the EBML format.

You can read the RFC over on the [IETF
site](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ebml/) in
different formats.
