# MKVToolNix

MKVToolNix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska &
WebM files under Windows, macOS, Linux and other Unices. It is the
de-facto reference implementation of a Matroska multiplexer.

MKVToolNix consists of the following command-line tools:

* `mkvmerge` is a tool to create Matroska & WebM files from other formats.
* `mkvinfo` allows one to get information about the tracks in Matroska & WebM files.
* `mkvextract` can extract tracks from Matroska & WebM files to other formats.
* `mkvpropedit` can edit properties such as header and chapter
  information or attachments without remuxing.

On top of them sits MKVToolNix GUI, an easy-to-use program making the
functionality of those command-line tools available as a GUI.
