# Source code repositories

## Official releases

There are many ways to get access to the source code. As a 3rd party
developper (user) you can download
[libmatroska](https://dl.matroska.org/downloads/libmatroska/) and
[libebml](https://dl.matroska.org/downloads/libebml/) from there
official location. If you are a Java developer you can checkout JEBML
from our [Git repository for a Java Matroska reading
library](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/jebml).

## Source code repositories (Git)

We provide the source code to all of our projects in Git repositories
hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/). There is one
repository per project (e.g.
[libEBML](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/libebml) and
[libMatroska](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/libmatroska)).

You can clone a Git repository with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Matroska-Org/repositoryname.git
```

e.g. for libMatroska:

```
git clone https://github.com/Matroska-Org/libmatroska.git
```

Visit the [Matroska.Org project page on
Github](https://github.com/Matroska-Org/) to see all available
repositories.

## Obsolete repositories

Some of the very old repositories have not been migrated to github.com.
The source code for those is still available in our old Subversion
repository which you can clone with the following command:

```
svn checkout https://matroska.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/matroska/trunk/
```
