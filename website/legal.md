## The Matroska association

Matroska is supported by a non-profit organisation in France
(association loi 1901). All official inquiries should go through that
association (see our [contact page](contact.html). We can sign Non
Disclosure Agreement (NDA) if your project/business requires it.

The Matroska association is currently composed of Steve Lhomme
(\"president\", founder of the project), Ludovic Vialle (\"trésorier\" =
accountant, supporter of the project since day 1) and Moritz Bunkus
(\"secrétaire\", maker of the MKVToolNix tools).

Matroska is an open and free technology. Anyone can use it or modify
it for their own needs without paying any license or patents.

However the name and the logo may **NOT** be used freely under some

by incorrect implementations or defamation. The name and logos may
only be used without any permission in non commercial context. For
commercial use (reading, writing, extending) we ask that you contact
us to make sure we can verify Matroska is used correctly. We do ask
that if you derive value from using Matroska that you are invited to
sponsor us to promote the use and evolution of Matroska
further. Please [contact us](contact.html) in such a case.

You can also make sure that your product(s) meet some minimum
